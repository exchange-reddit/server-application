# Gateway Service Codebase Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the Gateway Service codebase, a Spring Boot application written in Java and built with Gradle.

## Unit Testing with JUnit

The `gateway-service` uses JUnit 5 for unit and integration testing.

### `GatewayServiceApplicationTests.java`

*   **Purpose:** This is a basic integration test that verifies the Spring application context loads successfully.
*   **Key Annotations:**
    *   `@SpringBootTest`: Provides a convenient way to start up an application context for testing.
*   **Example Test Method:**
    *   `contextLoads()`: A simple test method annotated with `@Test` that asserts the context loads without exceptions. This is a common pattern to ensure the basic setup of the Spring Boot application is correct.
